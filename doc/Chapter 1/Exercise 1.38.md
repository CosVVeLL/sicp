### Exercise 1.38

In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir _De Fractionibus Continuis_, which included a continued fraction expansion for _e_ - 2, where _e is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the _N<sub>i</sub>_ are all 1, and the _D<sub>i</sub>_ are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, .... Write a program that uses your `cont-frac` procedure from [exercise 1.37](./Exercise%201.37.md) to approximate _e_, based on Euler's expansion.
