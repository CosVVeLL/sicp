### Exercise 2.53


 lists are said to be equal? if they contain equal elements arranged in the same order. For example,

```scheme
(equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list))
```

is true, but

```scheme
(equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))
```

is false. To be more precise, we can define `equal?` recursively in terms of the basic `eq?` equality of symbols by saying that `a` and `b` are `equal?` if they are both symbols and the symbols are `eq?`, or if they are both lists such that `(car a)` is `equal?` to `(car b)` and `(cdr a)` is `equal?` to `(cdr b)`. Using this idea, implement `equal?` as a procedure.

### Solution

```scheme
(define (equal? a b)
  (cond ((and (null? a) (null? b)) #t)
        ((or (null? a) (null? b)) #f)
        ((and (not (pair? a)) (not (pair? b)))
         (eq? a b))
        ((and (pair? a) (pair? b))
         (and (equal? (car a) (car b))
              (equal? (cdr a) (cdr b))))
        (else #f)))

(equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list)) 
; => #t

(equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list)) 
; => #f
```
