### Exercise 2.23

The procedure `for-each` is similar to `map`. It takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results, `  for-each` just applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from left to right. The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements are not used at all â€” `for-each` is used with procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For example,

```scheme
(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))
57
321
88
```

The value returned by the call to `for-each` (not illustrated above) can be something arbitrary, such as true. Give an implementation of `for-each`.

### Solution

```scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (print-square x) (newline) (display (square x)))

(define (for-each proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      #t
      (and (proc (car items))
           (for-each proc (cdr items)))))

(for-each print-square (list 1 2 3 4 5))
; 1
; 4
; 9
; 16
; 25
; => #t
```
