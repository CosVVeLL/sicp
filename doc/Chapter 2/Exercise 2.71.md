### Exercise 2.71

Suppose we have a Huffman tree for an alphabet of _n_ symbols, and that the relative frequencies of the symbols are 1, 2, 4, ..., 2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup>. Sketch the tree for _n_=5; for _n_=10. In such a tree (for general _n_) how many bits are required to encode the most frequent symbol? the least frequent symbol?

### Solution
