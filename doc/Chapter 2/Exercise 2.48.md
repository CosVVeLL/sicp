### Exercise 2.48

A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of vectors â€” the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector representation from [exercise 2.46](./Exercise%202.46.md) to define a representation for segments with a constructor `make-segment` and selectors `start-segment` and `end-segment`.
